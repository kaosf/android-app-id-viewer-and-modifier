# App ID Viewer (Empty App)

Display App ID in MainActivity.

...Now, you can change it very easily.

## Usage

This App ID is `com.example.app` defaultly. Change it to `net.kaosfield.awesomeapp` with a following command;

```sh
./rename.sh net kaosfield awesomeapp
```

Application ID will be changed to `net.kaosfield.awesomeapp` and the structure of directories also be modified.

Undo feature is implemented as `undo.sh`, but it is too naive (git command is required).
